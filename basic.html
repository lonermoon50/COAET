    <h1 style="margin-top: 1.6rem; margin-bottom: 1.6rem; margin-left: 1.6rem;">about the department</h1>
    <p style="margin-left: 1.6rem;">
        The department of Basic Engineering was established in March 2017 at the College of Agricultural Engineering & Technology (COAE&T),
        CCS Haryana Agricultural University, Hisar, Haryana. This department encompasses several important disciplines of engineering, in
        cluding Electrical Engineering, Mechanical Engineering, Electronics and Communication Engineering, and Civil Engineering.
        The Electrical & Electronics Engineering discipline aims to familiarize students with the latest knowledge of electrical
        and electronic equipment's, instrumentation and control systems, used in agricultural operations. It focuses on current 
        technologies such as precision agriculture, artificial intelligence, and electricity generation from renewable energy
        sources, which are utilized in agricultural processes. Additionally, students are trained in the use and development of 
        information technology tools. The Civil Engineering discipline is dedicated to providing knowledge in surveying, levelling 
        of farm fields, designing hydrological irrigation structures, farm structures and building designs, as well as structures for
        the agro-processing industry, silos, and bin designing, etc. The department is also involved in testing building materials. 
        Similarly, the Mechanical Engineering discipline trains the students in understanding engineering principles related to
        machine design, thermodynamics, material properties used in agricultural equipment design, and computer-aided design
        (CAD) and workshop technology. Overall, this discipline helps the other core departments of Agricultural Engineering 
        in designing and manufacturing efficient farm machinery equipment's and other relevant components that are essential for
        sustainable and modern agriculture operations.
